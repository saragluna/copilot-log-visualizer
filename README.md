   the website.

## 📖 Usage

### Capturing Logs with Mitmproxy

To capture logs from GitHub Copilot CLI, see [mitm/README.md](mitm/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Live Streaming Mode (Real-time)

**New!** Watch requests appear in real-time as they're captured:

1. **Start the visualizer**: Run `npm run build && npm start` and open http://localhost:3001
2. **Start mitmproxy**: In another terminal, run the proxy (see [mitm/README.md](mitm/README.md))
3. **Specify the log file path**: 
   - Default: `out.jsonl` (in the current working directory)
   - Relative path: e.g., `logs/out.jsonl`
   - Absolute path: e.g., `/path/to/your/out.jsonl`
4. **Click "Start Live Streaming"**: On the main page, click the green button to begin
5. **Run Copilot CLI**: Use the proxied copilot wrapper to run commands
6. **Watch in Real-time**: Requests appear instantly as they're captured
7. **Stop when done**: Click "Stop Live Stream" to pause

The live streaming mode watches the specified `.jsonl` file and automatically displays new requests as they're appended. This is perfect for:
- Debugging Copilot CLI interactions in real-time
- Monitoring token usage during development
- Understanding request/response patterns as they happen

### File Upload Mode (Historical)

1. **Upload Log File**: Drag and drop your `.jsonl` log file onto the page, or click to browse
2. **Browse Requests**: All HTTP requests appear in the left sidebar with method, status, and timing
3. **View Details**: Click on any request to view its full details
4. **Switch Tabs**: Use "Request" and "Response" tabs to see headers and body

### Filtering Requests

1. **Open Filter**: Click the "Filter" dropdown at the top of the request list
2. **Select Paths**: Check/uncheck API paths to show only relevant requests
3. **Persistent Selection**: Your filter choices are saved and restored on reload
4. **Auto-Reset**: Filters automatically clear when loading a file with different paths

### Navigating Tool Calls

For OpenAI chat completion requests with tool calls:

1. **From Tool Call to Result**: Click the tool call ID in an assistant message to jump to the corresponding tool message
2. **From Result to Tool Call**: Click the tool_call_id in a tool message to jump back to the specific tool call
3. **Auto-Expand**: Messages are automatically expanded when navigating
4. **Highlight**: Target element is temporarily highlighted for easy identification

## How It Works

### Capturing Logs with Mitmproxy

The application uses [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) to intercept and capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic from GitHub Copilot CLI:

1. **Proxy Setup**: Mitmproxy runs as a man-in-the-middle proxy on `127.0.0.1:8080`
2. **Traffic Capture**: A custom Python script (`mitm-to-json.py`) captures each request/response in real-time
3. **JSON Conversion**: Each HTTP transaction is converted to a JSON object with:
   - Request/response headers and body
   - Timing information (start timestamp and completion time)
   - HTTP method, URL, and status code
4. **JSONL Output**: Each transaction is written as a single line to `out.jsonl`

The captured log file is then loaded into this visualizer for analysis. See [mitm/README.md](mitm/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Backend (NestJS)

- **LogService**: Parses `.jsonl` files, aggregates chunked responses, and handles Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **StreamService**: Watches `out.jsonl` file for changes and streams new requests via SSE
- **AppController**: Provides endpoints for serving the UI, parsing log files, and streaming
- **JSON Parsing**: Automatically detects and parses JSON in request/response bodies

### Frontend

- **Drag & Drop**: File upload with drag-and-drop support
- **Live Streaming**: EventSource-based real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- **Request List**: Displays all parsed requests with method, status, URL, and timing
- **Detail View**: Shows complete request/response information including headers and body
- **Responsive**: Clean, modern interface inspired by Chrome DevTools

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Serves the main HTML page
- `POST /parse` - Accepts log content and returns parsed requests
- `GET /stream?file=out.jsonl` - Server-Sent Events endpoint for live streaming

## Log Format

The application expects `.jsonl` files where each line is a JSON object with this structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "completed": "ISO 8601 timestamp (optional)",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/path",
  "method": "POST",
  "status_code": 200,
  "request": {
    "headers": {},
    "body": "string or JSON"
  },
  "response": {
    "headers": {},
    "body": "string, JSON, or SSE format"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Request Aggregation

Multiple log entries for the same request (identified by timestamp and URL) are automatically merged:
- Streaming response chunks are combined intelligently
- Duration is calculated from first to last chunk
- All response data is preserved

### OpenAI Streaming Response Merging

For `/chat/completions` requests with streaming responses:
- **Delta Merging**: Combines partial `content` strings across chunks
- **Tool Calls**: Merges tool call deltas by index, building complete function calls
- **Field Preservation**: All fields (including reasoning_text, reasoning_opaque, refusal, etc.) are preserved
- **Usage Statistics**: Token counts from the final chunk are included
- **Structured View**: Merged response is rendered with expandable Choices and Metadata cards

### Request List Display

The request list shows context-specific information:

**For `/chat/completions` requests:**
- HTTP method (left) | Message/tool summary (center) | Status code (right)
- URL path on second line
- Timing and token usage on third line
- Message counts: `U2/S1/A3/R2/T5` = 2 user, 1 system, 3 assistant, 2 tool messages, 5 tools
- Token usage: `1234/567` = input tokens / output tokens

**For other requests:**
- HTTP method (left) | Status code (right)
- URL path on second line
- Timing on third line

### Message Display

Request messages are rendered with special handling:

- **Content**: Main message content (text or JSON)
- **Refusal**: Displayed with red styling if present
- **Reasoning Fields**: Any reasoning-related fields shown with blue styling
- **Tool Calls**: Rendered as structured cards with function name, arguments, and clickable IDs
- **Tool Messages**: Show tool_call_id in header for navigation back to the original call

### Filter Persistence

Filter selections are stored in browser localStorage:
- Selections survive page reloads
- Maintained when loading new files (if paths match)
- Automatically reset only when no selected paths exist in new data
- Stored as JSON array of path strings

## 🎨 UI Features

### Collapsible Sections

All content sections can be collapsed/expanded:
- **Request View**: General, Messages, Tools, Metadata sections
- **Response View**: Choices, Metadata, Merged Body, Raw Body sections
- **Messages**: Individual message cards can be collapsed
- **Smart Defaults**: Most-used sections expanded by default

### Visual Indicators

- **Status Badges**: Green for 2xx, red for errors
- **Method Badges**: Color-coded HTTP methods
- **Token Counts**: Tooltips explain abbreviations
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle highlighting on interactive elements
- **Selection Highlight**: Active request shown with blue background

## 📝 Log Format

The application expects `.jsonl` files where each line is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T08:00:00.000Z",
  "completed": "2024-01-20T08:00:01.234Z",
  "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
  "method": "POST",
  "status_code": 200,
  "request": {
    "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    "body": { "messages": [...], "tools": [...] }
  },
  "response": {
    "headers": { "Content-Type": "text/event-stream" },
    "body": "data: {...}\n\ndata: {...}\n\n" // or JSON object
  }
}
```

### Response Body Formats

The tool handles multiple response body formats:

1. **JSON Object**: Standard JSON response
2. **SSE Format**: Server-Sent Events with `data:` lines
3. **Array**: Pre-parsed SSE chunks as array of objects
4. **Chunked Array**: Multiple response bodies merged into array
